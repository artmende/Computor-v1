exponents_array = re.findall("(?<=\^)-?[.0-9]+", equation_string) # get the exponent value
--> get an array with all the exponents
--> remove all duplicate from that array
--> use that array to do the reduced equation
do the normalize_coeff_and_exponents before that !!



in the ckeck for error, let all range of exponent pass

that group of character CANNOT be followed by x
